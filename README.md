# Overview

This code requests baseball data from a server. The code consist of using abstract classes, and it overrides a function
that will be called and changed in other classes. This code also uses the extends 
key word. This code will ask the user certain details, and it will convert the server JSON into data that the user
should be able to read easily. I chose to do this project because I wanted this program for myself. I like watching baseball
and I like looking at stats. On the other hand, I did this project, so I can learn how API's and 
making calls to servers work. I wanted to understand how that code works, and now I can better understand it.

# Development Environment

I used AI to help me solve problems and get a groundwork of how some things worked. AI helped
me to speed up the time to learn more and add more details to my project.

I used C# and it is a code that seem to understand a lot better than other coding languages. I used
Newtonsoft.JSON, and it is a library that can serialize objects to JSON, or it can deserialize objects from JSON.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I need to reduce the amount of similar code or put it in a parent class.
- I want to add more functions that will gather other MLB data.
- I need to improve the readability in some areas of the code.
